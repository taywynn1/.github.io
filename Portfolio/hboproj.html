				<h2>Interaction Map</h2><br>
				<p>In order to understand our product, HBO Go, better we created an interaction map - essentially how a user would try to find a movie to watch.</p>

				<h2>Research</h2><br>
				<p>To better understand the existing movie-streaming services and what users want, we carried out:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Competitive research</li>
					<li>User interviews</li>
				</ul><br>
			</div>
			<div class = 'outline'>
				<h2>Competitive Research</h2><br>
				<p>We compared the sites listed below to see what some of HBO Go's competitors are and are not doing.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Hulu</li>
					<li>YouTube Red</li>
					<li>Netflix</li>
					<li>New York Times</li>

				<br><h2>User Interviews</h2><br>
				<p>I created a screener survey that we sent out to our social networks. We then carried out full interviews with individuals that completed the survey and stream HBO Go movies frequently.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>10 survey responses</li>
					<li>8 interviews</li>

					<p>At 4PM, Chad finishes his junior-level accounting exam at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business. He tiredly opens his planner to see what he has written in to do for the evening, but he notices that he only has a Finance problem set due tomorrow by noon. He blocks off 45 minutes for dinner and 2 hours for the finance problem set. In need of relaxation, he decides that he will use the remainder of his evening to watch “Hidden Figures,” an award-winning movie he has been intending to see for a few weeks now. After eating his Ramen dinner, he opens his laptop to complete his finance programming homework. After he finishes this homework, he happily changes out of his business casual clothing and opens up his laptop to Netflix. He uses his parents’ account to save money. He searches for the movie on Netflix first, but he does not find the title; therefore, he switches to HBO Go and searches for the title in the search bar. As he is typing the word “Hidden,” the movie appears in the search results. He clicks play directly from this screen but pauses to brush his teeth and set a cell phone alarm for 7AM. He starts the movie at about 9:00 PM and stays up until about 11 PM finish it. Therefore, he is able to get an adequate eight hours of sleep to perform at his best the next day, but he also feels rejuvenated and relaxed.</p><br>

					<p>Angelica starts her day at 11 AM, because she was up very late watching two different short films that she discovered on HBO Go. During her Cinematography II class, she can’t stop thinking about the first film. It provided commentary on racism in America, and it resonated with her deeply. Films that concern social ills and diversity are of most interest to Angelica. This evening, she is going to look for another film on the same subject. She expects to be able to find yet another thought-provoking film on HBO Go. Her friend, Sam, asks if Angelica wants to get drinks at a local bar with some of their other friends, but she declines. She must satisfy her craving for a new film, and she feels most comfortable doing it alone. Without paying attention to homework she has, Angelica easily dissolves into her laptop; she jumps to HBO Go first and begins to wade through it. HBO Go is Angelica’s one-stop shop, because she believes it has higher quality films on average than Netflix. She starts in the “Drama” section. She reads through movie descriptions one by one. She opens two separate windows in her browser and open IMDB ratings in one and New York Times reviews in the other. Angelica uses these resources as tools to help her select a movie. She settles on a documentary film on the topic of social justice. She is excited to explore this movie’s representation of the issue. Her eyes are glued to the screen for the duration of the film. She goes onto Rotten Tomatoes to rate the movie herself and reflects deeply on it. She believes that she is arming herself with knowledge about diversity in film to eventually become an informed movie critic. Although she will be tired for school and her job tomorrow, she feels that is worth it to stay up and absorb everything she can from these films.</p><br>

					<p>Joe would use his mobile application “GroupMe” to create a group chat with five other friends in his social circle on Tuesday as he is making plans for the weekend. He asks the group if they are all available on Friday night at around 9PM to watch a movie. All five of his friends indicate that they are available and would also like to order food for the movie. Joe is nervous about his friends eating during the movie, because he will not be able to hear it very well. He spends the next day researching movies that his friends might like. Last time he hosted a movie night, Terry complained about the movie genre being a Horror movie. Based on his friends’ genre preferences, he narrowed the two possible movie genres down to Comedy or Action. He asked the group if they would want to watch a Comedy movie or an Action Movie. Terry suggested a Comedy, and the rest of the group seemed satisfied with this. Joe suggested “The Hangover” or “22 Jump Street.” Terry and Sheila immediately agreed on “21 Jump Street,” but Joe was nervous that the other four would not be on board. To his relief, his other four friends expressed that they would also like to watch “21 Jump Street.” He checked Netflix first and found it there as he suspected, because he expects to find a wider selection of these kinds of “blockbuster” movies on Netflix. Joe was motivated to finish all of his homework before the weekend, so he got to work. On Friday, Joe welcomed his friends over to his house. His friends opened a loud bag of chips and soda cans. Therefore, he enabled subtitles directly in the movie’s play bar, incase loud chewing and bag crinkling would make it difficult to hear. Several of his friends have to use the bathroom throughout the movie, but they easily rewind to parts missed using the 10-second jump-back button. Joe’s friends were all grateful to Joe for hosting the event, and Joe enjoyed the movie. Joe was happy about choosing the right movie and spending time with his friends.</p><br>
